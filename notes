Enhance ProductController class (retrieveProductById method) with validating productId by using orElseThrow() method

Enhance ProductController class (deleteProductById method) with validating productId by orElseThrow() method

Validate the product code (experiment with static block) - it should have only first three characters as alphabets
and the rest are the numerics - it should be only alphanumeric and there should be no special characters.

Add "codeLastModified" field in the Product entity.

Enhance global exceptions

Enhance saveProduct @ Controller - remove Conflict and apply appropriate HTTP status and send an appropriate message.
                         
map() implementation                         
                            
flatMap() implementation 

filter() implementation - filter the products with their product codes.
Eg: Some products can have the product code starts with VUI(VUI1234567), some with OUP(OUP1234567), and some with AVB(AVB1234567).
So these have to be filtered according to their product code that starts with OUT, VUI, AVB, etc.

Sorting the products based on product name - first flatMap() to be applied to get the list of initials of all the products using flatMap()
and then sorting technique should be used.
